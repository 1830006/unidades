(2, 'Jonathan G. Ferrar ll', 'Labeled as “The Artist to Watch in 2016” by the London Review, Johnathan has already sold one of the highest priced commissions paid to an art student, ever on record.

Hillary’s CAC exhibit features paintings that contain only water images including waves, deep sea, and river.', 'Hillary_Goldwynn_tn.jpg'),
(4, 'Hassum Harrod', 'The Art College in New Dehli has sponsored Hassum for his entire undergraduate career at the university, seeing great promise in his contemporary paintings of landscapes - that use equal parts muted and vibrant tones.

(8, 'Riley Rudolph Rewington', 'A first-year student at the Roux Academy of Art, Media, and Design, Riley is already changing the face of modern art at the university. Riley’s exquisite abstract pieces have no intention of ever being understood, but instead beg the viewer to dream, create, pretend, and envision with their mind’s eye. Riley will be speaking on the “Art of Abstract” during Thursday’s schedule.', 'Riley_Rewington_tn.jpg'),
(9, 'Xhou Ta', 'A senior at the China International Art University, Xhou has become well-known for his miniature sculptures, often the size of a rice granule, that are displayed by rear projection of microscope images on canvas.
